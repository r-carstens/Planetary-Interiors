# Planetary-Interiors

The bash scripts were used during a Senior Honours 'Planetary Interiors' project.

In order to use either script, it is necessary that the AIRSS software package is installed. The installation is avaliable via:
https://airss-docs.github.io/getting-started/installation/

To generate convex hulls, along with the AIRSS package, Qhull is required to be installed. The package is available for download via:
http://www.qhull.org/download/

The aim of both scripts is to process data by using the CASTEP software package, which is availiable at:
http://www.castep.org/


The scripts were based on information made available by:
